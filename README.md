Providing Easy To Integrate IBFT Digital Payment Services.

== Upgrade Notice ==

This is an upgrade of Simpaisa IBFT Payment Services version 1.0.9

== Description ==

* Simpaisa IBFT (Inter Bank Funds Transfer)
Simpaisa Plug-in for IBFT  covers two methods and makes it easier for customers to complete their payments directly from their bank accounts.
= Method 1: Push IBFT =
This method leads to a payment token once the details have been entered. The token or voucher can easily be paid from any e-banking portal along with mobile wallet accounts.
Once the payment has been made against the token the merchant can easily monitor success transactions in the reporting portal.
= Method 2: Pull IBFT =
This method saves a lot of time since it deducts money directly from the bank account of the user once the correct details have been entered. Only the user having an active e-banking or online banking can pay via pull IBFT method.
All the transactions which are done via simpaisa plugins can be easily traced on simpaisa portal, In order to use the plug-in one must have merchant ID assigned by Simpaisa Team.
Note: To collect your merchant ID and discuss the process, please contact simpaisa team today.
